  "description": "This sample application allows you to ask natural language questions of any PDF document you upload. It combines the text generation and analysis capabilities of an LLM with a vector search of the document content. The solution uses serverless services such as [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) to access foundational models, [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) to run [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), and [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) for conversational memory.",
